# Yes, I am Present 🙋‍♂️

`Yes, I am Present` is a Chrome Extension that checks if your name is called in a Google Meet meeting. The extension periodically checks if your name appeared in the closed captions (of the conversation) generated by the Google Meet. If found, it unmutes your microphone for a few seconds (so that other participants think you are active 😜, but having some difficulty with your mic 🤫).


### Installation
* Download the commpressed (.zip) file from this repo and Extract in a new folder.
* Open **Extensions** page on Google Chrome (or any chromium based browser). 
* Enable **Developer Mode** by clicking the toggle switch next to Developer mode.
* Click the **Load unpacked** button and select the extension directory (the unzipped folder) path.
* Ta-da! The extension has been successfully installed.
